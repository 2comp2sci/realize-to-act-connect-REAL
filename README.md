## Disclaimer
Many features are broken. Will release separate .md detailing features in progress and those that are functional (internally).

## Run Locally
-- generic instructions from Firebase CLI Gemini AI something something something... anyways 
**Prerequisites:**  Node.js


1. Install dependencies:
   `npm install`
2. Set the `GEMINI_API_KEY` in [.env.local](.env.local) to your Gemini API key
3. Run the app:
   `npm run dev`

## Backend: Firebase Auth + Firestore
-- this is more specific to this app.
Messages, chats, connection/supply requests (sent & received, including the
resource manifest in `schoolRequestData`), organization profiles, and
acknowledgement letters awaiting signature are stored in Cloud Firestore and
read live via `onSnapshot` — there is no separate server. The data-access
code lives in `src/lib/` (`requests.ts`, `chats.ts`, `connections.ts`,
`profiles.ts`, `users.ts`, `documents.ts`); the schema and security rules are
documented at the top of those files and in `firestore.rules`.

### One-time Firebase project setup
--done already on MM laptop (mine)
1. Create a project at https://console.firebase.google.com, then enable
   **Authentication** (Email/Password + Google providers) and **Firestore**.
2. In Project Settings > General > "Your apps", add a Web app and copy its
   config values into a `.env.local` (see `.env.example` for the required
   `VITE_FIREBASE_*` keys).
3. Set the project id in `.firebaserc` (replace
   `REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`).
4. Install the Firebase CLI if you don't have it: `npm install -g firebase-tools`,
   then `firebase login`.

### Deploying -- some helpful commands xoxo

```
npm run build   # outputs to dist/, matches firebase.json's hosting.public
npm run deploy   # builds, then deploys Hosting + Firestore rules/indexes
```

`npm run deploy` is equivalent to
`firebase deploy --only hosting,firestore:rules,firestore:indexes`, which
pushes:
- `dist/` (the Vite build output) to Firebase Hosting, per `firebase.json`.
- `firestore.rules` — access control for the `users`, `publicProfiles`,
  `requests`, `requests-sent`, `connections`, `documents`, and
  `chats`/`messages` collections.
- `firestore.indexes.json` — composite indexes required by the
  `subscribeToRequests`/`subscribeToChats` queries.

Remember to add your deployed Hosting domain (and `localhost` for local dev)
to Authentication > Settings > Authorized domains in the Firebase Console,
and to redeploy `firestore.rules`/`firestore.indexes.json` any time the
schema in `src/lib/requests.ts` or `src/lib/chats.ts` changes.
